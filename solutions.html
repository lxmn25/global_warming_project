						<strong> Alternative energy encompasses all those things that do not consume fossil fuel. </strong> They are widely available and environment friendly, causing little or almost no pollution. There have been several alternative energy projects running in various countries to reduce our dependence on traditional fossil fuels. There are many impressive options that you can take into consideration. Here in you will learn more about alternative energy sources that you can take into consideration.

					<p id="q3"> <strong> Q: Is global warming too big for me to do anything about it personally? </strong> </p>

					<div id="p3_col1">
						<p><strong>No. There are many simple steps you can take right now to cut carbon pollution.</strong> Make conserving energy a part of your daily routine and your decisions as a consumer. When you shop for new appliances like refrigerators, washers, and dryers, look for products with the government’s Energy Star label; they meet a higher standard for energy efficiency than the minimum federal requirements. When you buy a car, look for one with the highest gas mileage and lowest emissions. You can also reduce your emissions by taking public transportation or carpooling when possible.

						And while new federal and state standards are a step in the right direction, much more needs to be done. Voice your support of climate-friendly and climate change preparedness policies, and tell your representatives that transitioning from dirty fossil fuels to clean power should be a top priority—because it’s vital to building healthy, more secure communities.
